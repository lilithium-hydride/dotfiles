# Lilith's Dotfiles

### Installation
Just a fair warning, this is meant for my own personal use and I cannot guarantee any positive or negative effects from running blindly through the installation procedure. Take what you wish from the files, but don't run any commands you don't understand the effects of.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lilithium-hydride/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd stow
stow -vSt ~ zsh
```
